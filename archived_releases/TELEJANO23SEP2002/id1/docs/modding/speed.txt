if you want speed, try:

0) disable shadows (r_shadows)
1) disabling gl_detail and gl_geocaustic
3) disable dinamic light, etc,..
4) disable static particle effect,... (static_fx)
5) increase gl_particle_limiter
6) disable v_refresh limit in your card config
7) decrement extra_fx cvar

Anyway this engine is not designed for pure speed.
